v0.87.0 — Current Tune Intelligence & UX Polish

Status: Stable
Baseline: v0.86.3 (Phase 3 complete)

✨ Highlights

Strong time-decay aggregation (“Current Tune” dominates)

Recent sessions weighted heavily

Historical data retained as low-weight context

14-day half-life with decay floor

1000y-first diagnostic tuning

Vertical diagnostics gated at ≥10 shots

New 1000y vertical severity bands:

🟢 ≤ 0.80 MOA — competitive

🟡 0.81–1.05 MOA — watch / tuneable

🟠 1.06–1.30 MOA — likely velocity-limited (tuneable)

🔴 > 1.30 MOA — likely non-competitive

Improved velocity diagnostics (ES vs SD)

SD treated as primary signal

ES inflated by single outlier detected and soft-flagged

Reduced false “bad velocity” conclusions

Ranking table overhaul

Sorted by recent 1000y vertical + confidence

Badge icons only (icon opacity reflects confidence)

Rank stability via hysteresis (prevents jitter)

Rows with no recent 1000y data visibly de-emphasized

Drilldown UX polish

Default view: Current Tune

Toggle: Current Tune / All Time

Diagnostics grouped by cause:

Velocity / Vertical

Wind / Horizontal

Mechanical

Shooter / Process

Low-confidence and historical findings suppressed by default

New: “Last Improved” indicator

Detects meaningful recent improvement in 1000y vertical

Requires confidence + non-contradiction by newer data

Shown subtly in ranking table and drilldown summary

🧠 Behavioral Notes

Diagnostics favor repeatability over single groups

Strong recent performance suppresses historical warnings

Tool now reflects how loads are actually tuned and evaluated
