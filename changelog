🚀 v0.87.0 — Current Tune Intelligence & UX Polish

Baseline: v0.86.3 (Phase 3 complete)

✨ What’s New

Current Tune–first aggregation

Strong time decay (14-day half-life) so recent sessions dominate

Historical data retained as low-weight context

1000y diagnostic tuning

Vertical diagnostics gated at ≥10 shots

New 1000y vertical bands:

🟢 ≤ 0.80 MOA — competitive

🟡 0.81–1.05 MOA — watch / tuneable

🟠 1.06–1.30 MOA — likely velocity-limited (tuneable)

🔴 > 1.30 MOA — likely non-competitive

Improved velocity analysis

SD treated as primary signal

ES inflated by single outliers detected and soft-flagged

Reduced false velocity warnings

Ranking table overhaul

Sorted by recent 1000y vertical + confidence

Icon-only badges with confidence-based opacity

Rank stability improvements (reduced jitter)

Drilldown UX polish

Default view: Current Tune

Toggle: Current Tune / All Time

Diagnostics grouped by cause

Low-confidence & historical findings suppressed by default

New: “Last Improved” indicator

Detects meaningful recent improvement in 1000y vertical

Requires confidence and non-contradiction by newer data

Shown subtly in ranking table and drilldown summary

🧠 Notes

Diagnostics favor repeatability over single groups

Strong recent performance suppresses historical warnings

Rankings now reflect how loads are tuned and evaluated right now
