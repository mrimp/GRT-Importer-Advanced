🧱 BUILD ORDER (Do Not Skip)
1️⃣ Core Math First (foundation)

Lock these before touching UI:

 decayWeight(ageDays)

 Shot-count confidence (shotConfidenceWeight)

 1000y vertical severity bands

 ES outlier vs SD logic

 Repeatability support score

👉 Once this is solid, everything else becomes predictable.

2️⃣ Aggregation Layer

Per load:

 Build currentTuneVertical(loadSessions)

 Build decayed confidence vector

 Compute overall ranking score

 Enforce hysteresis on rank ordering

⚠️ Don’t render anything yet. Console-log this until it’s boring.

3️⃣ “Last Improved” Hook (logic only)

 Compute prior-tune baseline

 Compare vs current tune

 Apply ≥0.15 MOA or severity-drop rule

 Gate on confidence

 Attach load.improvement object

Once this exists, the rest is paint.

4️⃣ Ranking Table UI

 Replace text badges with icons

 Apply opacity = decayed confidence

 Insert ↑ improvement icon + tooltip

 De-emphasize no-recent-1000y rows

 Verify sorting feels right by eye

If this feels good, you’re 80% done.

5️⃣ Drilldown UI

 Add Current Tune / All Time toggle

 Group diagnostics by cause

 Suppress low-confidence/historical by default

 Add summary strip (recency explanation)

 Expand shows triggers + sessions

6️⃣ Final Polish + Guardrails

 Null-safe formatting everywhere

 Empty states explain why

 Expand/collapse timing (120–150ms)

 Sanity test with:

Known-good load

Known-bad load

Single 1000y session

🔒 RULES WHILE BUILDING

No new features

No refactors

If it feels wrong, stop and inspect the math

Trust the thresholds — we tuned them on purpose
