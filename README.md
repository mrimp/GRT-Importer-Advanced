🎯 GRT Importer Advanced — ShotMarker-First Load Analysis

GRT Importer Advanced is a precision load-analysis tool designed for long-range shooters who want more than raw numbers. It transforms ShotMarker target data (with optional chronograph support) into actionable diagnostics that tell you why a load behaves the way it does — and whether it’s improving.
At its core, the tool treats ShotMarker as truth.

🔍 What Makes It Different
Instead of chasing single “good groups,” GRT Importer Advanced analyzes patterns, repeatability, and recency, with a strong bias toward 1000-yard performance.
It automatically:
Separates record shots from sighters (sighters never pollute scoring)
Evaluates vertical, horizontal, and group shape directly from target impact data
Applies confidence weighting based on shot count, repeatability, and session quality
Uses time decay so your current tune matters more than old history
The result is calm, honest diagnostics — no badge spam, no false certainty.

🧠 ShotMarker-Driven Intelligence
From ShotMarker target files, the tool derives:
Mean Radius, vertical & horizontal dispersion
Stringing vs roundness diagnostics
1000y-specific vertical severity bands
Session confidence and repeatability scoring
Ranking of charges based on what works now, not what worked months ago
If velocity data is present, it’s integrated intelligently.
If it isn’t, the tool stays target-only and honest — never guessing.

📊 Built for Real Load Development
Key features shooters notice immediately:
Ranking table that surfaces the best charge right now
Drilldowns that explain why a load is flagged or trusted
Automatic detection of meaningful improvement (“Last Improved ↑”)
Clear separation between signal and noise
Designed around how competitive shooters actually evaluate loads
This isn’t a spreadsheet replacement — it’s a decision tool.

🟢 Who It’s For
F-Class, Long Range, and precision shooters using ShotMarker
Shooters tuning loads across multiple sessions
Anyone who cares more about repeatable performance than cherry-picked groups
